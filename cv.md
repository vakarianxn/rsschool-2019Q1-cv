3. Although I graduated from a humanitarian faculty of BSU, programming has always been my dream -- since  high school I've wanted 
   to try it, but never had the courage to. After I've worked in IT industry for a year, I've come to an understanding that I have 
   all the skills for this job, and I'm not planning to let go of my dream. 
   I'm very good and fast at learning new stuff -- give some time and I'll find out everything about the matter -- as a fresh 
   release manager back at Flo, I've bexome skilled and capable of solving any issue regarding my job in two months (ant that's s lot
   of responsibility and information); 
   I'm very eager to learn and I've got understanding of quite some essential processes and I'm always very eager to learn new stuff.

8. English: C1. Have been side to side with this language all my life -- got a very good lexical and grammatical preparation back at 
   school (both self-education and teaching), then upped my spoken English while studying in China for 1 year to a fluent level (also 
   played online with my British friends, thus accepted the British accent from them).
